# Debian Package File Statistics Tool

This Python tool fetches and ranks Debian packages based on the number of associated files for a given architecture. It accesses a specified architecture's Contents file from the Debian repository, parses the file, and outputs the statistics of the packages that have the most files associated with them.

## Features

- **Fetch Contents**: Retrieves Contents files for specified architectures from the Debian repository.
- **Analyze File Associations**: Counts and analyzes file associations per package.
- **Display Statistics**: Shows the top packages with the most associated files. Users can specify the number of top packages to display.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `requests`
- `click`

## Installation

First, ensure that Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
env\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source env/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line by specifying an architecture. Here is how you can use the script:

```bash
python package_statistics.py [architecture] --top-n [number]
```

### Arguments

- `architecture`: The architecture for which you want to fetch and analyze package file statistics. 
  - Supported architectures include: `amd64`, `arm64`, `armel`, `armhf`, `i386`, `mips64el`, `mipsel`, `ppc64el`, `s390x`
  - Users can also specify `all` for packages that are architecture-independent, or `source` for source packages.
- `--top-n`: Optional. Specifies the number of top packages to display. The default is 10.

### Examples

To get the top 10 packages for the amd64 architecture, you would run:

```bash
python package_statistics.py amd64
```

To get the top 5 packages for the arm64
architecture, you would run:

```bash
python package_statistics.py arm64 --top-n 5
```

## Logging

The script uses Python's built-in `logging` module to provide debug outputs and error messages. You can adjust the logging level in the script if needed.
